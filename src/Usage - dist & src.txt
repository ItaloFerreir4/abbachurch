"src" Directory:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

• Purpose: The "src" (short for source) directory is used during the development phase to house your source code, assets, and development files.

• Purpose: Contains source code and development files.
• Contents: Unoptimized HTML, CSS, JavaScript, original assets.
